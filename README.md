## 🟢 JavaScript Exercises (Tier 1 - Beginner)

### 1. 🌀 Fibonacci Sequence Generator

Write an arrow function that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

### 2. 🔢 Array Filtering

Create an arrow function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers.

### 3. ✨ String Capitalizer

Implement an arrow function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string.

### 4. 🔄 Variable Scope Demonstration

Demonstrate the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` by writing a function that declares variables using each keyword within different scopes (e.g., inside a loop or conditional).

### 5. 🛡️ Immutable Object Creation

Use `const` to create an object and attempt to modify its properties. Explain the behavior.

### 6. 👋 Personalized Greeting

Write a function that takes a user's name and age and returns a personalized greeting message using template literals.

### 7. 🖼️ HTML Snippet Generator

Create a function that generates a simple HTML card component as a string using template literals. The card should include a title, image URL, and description.

### 8. 📦 Object Destructuring

Given an object representing a book with properties like `title`, `author`, `year`, and `genre`, use destructuring to extract these properties into separate variables.

### 9. 📑 Array Destructuring

Write a function that takes an array of user information `[firstName, lastName, email]` and uses destructuring to assign each element to a corresponding variable.

### 10. ➕ Merging Arrays

Use the spread operator to merge two arrays into one.

### 11. 📚 Function Argument Collector

Create a function that accepts any number of numerical arguments and returns their sum using the rest operator.

### 12. 🏗️ Class Creation

Define a `Person` class with properties `name` and `age`, and a method `greet()` that returns a greeting message.

### 13. 🌱 Inheritance Implementation

Create a `Student` class that inherits from the `Person` class and adds an additional property `grade`. Override the `greet()` method to include the student's grade in the message.

### 14. 📤 Module Export and Import

Create two JavaScript files where one file exports a function and the other imports and uses that function.

### 15. 🏷️ Named vs. Default Exports

Demonstrate the difference between named and default exports by creating examples of each and showing how to import them.

### 16. ⏳ Basic Promise

Write a function that returns a promise which resolves after 2 seconds with a message `"Promise Resolved!"`.

### 17. 🌐 Fetching Data with Promises

Create a function that fetches data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) using `fetch` and handles the response with `.then()` and `.catch()`.

### 18. 🚀 Async/Await Implementation

Rewrite the previous exercise using `async/await` syntax instead of `.then()` and `.catch()`.

### 19. 🔄 Custom Iterator

Implement a custom iterator for an object that allows iterating over its properties using a `for...of` loop.

### 20. 🔬 Generator Function

Write a generator function that yields the first `n` prime numbers.

### 21. 🔍 Find and Filter

Given an array of user objects, write a function to find a user by their ID and another function to filter users based on a specific criteria (e.g., age greater than 30).

### 22. 💰 Reduce to Compute Totals

Use the `reduce` method to calculate the total price of items in a shopping cart array.

### 23. 🛠️ Try/Catch Implementation

Write a function that attempts to parse a JSON string and uses `try/catch` to handle any potential errors gracefully.

### 24. 📡 API Data Retrieval

Use any library (like `axios`) or the built-in `fetch()` to call an API and retrieve data.
